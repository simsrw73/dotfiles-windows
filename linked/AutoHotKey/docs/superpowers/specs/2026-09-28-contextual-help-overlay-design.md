# Contextual help overlay

## Goal

One help key (Alt+/) shows the shortcuts that matter right now, without
looking away from the screen: the active app's page if it has one, otherwise
an index of pages to drill into. Every AutoHotkey binding registers through
one API that records its page, category, group and description, and
hand-written Markdown pages add documentation-only shortcuts (an app's native
keys) that anyone can share. The overlay is built from that data, so it never
drifts from the real bindings.

Replaces the hand-maintained `CheatSheet` in `WindowManager.ahk`. The Win+Space
chord menu (`Chords.ahk`) is a separate feature and is not changed.

## Requirements

- Bindings made in AHK and documentation-only shortcuts from Markdown files
  merge into the same pages.
- Bound and doc-only shortcuts are visually distinct (theme colors), with the
  option to make them identical.
- Context: the page matching the active window opens first; otherwise an
  index.
- Hierarchy: index → page → category, with `###` groups as headings on a
  screen and extra screens when a list overflows.
- While the overlay is open, a Ctrl/Alt/Win combo closes it and reaches the
  app or AHK binding unchanged.
- A pin mode keeps the overlay up while combos pass through.
- Theming: colors, fonts, layout and key notation; shareable theme files;
  light/dark following Windows.
- Optional legend line explaining the key notation on the current screen.

## Page files

Pages live in `Help/pages/*.md`. The parser reads a strict Markdown subset line
by line and ignores everything else, so notes and links can sit anywhere and
the file renders normally on GitHub or in Obsidian.

```markdown
---
match: ahk_exe zen.exe
key: z
---
# Zen

Notes are ignored.

## Tabs
### Open & close
- `Ctrl+T` New tab
- `Ctrl+Shift+T` Reopen closed tab

### Navigate
- `Ctrl+Tab` Next tab
```

| Markdown | Meaning |
|---|---|
| front matter `match:` | AHK WinTitle criteria for the page; absent means global |
| front matter `key:` | fixed index letter (optional) |
| `# Title` | page title (first one only); pages merge by title, case-insensitive |
| `## Heading` | category |
| `### Heading` | group within a category; entries before any `###` go in an unnamed group |
| ``- `keys` description`` | a shortcut; ``` `` `` ``` delimits keys containing a backtick |
| anything else | ignored |

Entries before any `##` go in an unnamed category. A line that starts like an
entry (`- \``) but cannot be parsed (unclosed backtick, unknown key name) is
skipped and recorded as a warning with file and line number. A file with no
`# Title` is skipped with a warning. The script never fails to start because of
a page file.

## Code API (`Keys`)

Two explicit forms; there is no implicit "current page" state.

Table form, for declarative blocks:

```ahk
komorebi := Keys.Page("komorebi")                   ; global
komorebi.Category("Focus / move / stack", [
    ["!h", "focus left",  (*) => Komorebi.Run("focus", "left"), {Row: "Alt+H/J/K/L", Text: "focus ← ↓ ↑ →"}],
    ["!j", "focus down",  (*) => Komorebi.Run("focus", "down"), {Row: "Alt+H/J/K/L"}],
], "Focus")                                          ; optional group

zen := Keys.Page("Zen", "ahk_exe zen.exe", {Key: "z"})
zen.Category("Tabs", [
    ["#+o", "open tab in Chrome", (*) => OpenCurrentZenTabInChrome()],
])
```

One-line form, for loops and complicated code:

```ahk
Keys.Bind(["komorebi", "Workspaces", "Focus"], "!" i, "focus " name, FocusWorkspaceHotkey(name))
```

- `Keys.Page(title, match?, options?)` returns the same object for the same
  title (case-insensitive). If `match` or `Key` is given both in code and in a
  file and they differ, code wins and a warning is recorded.
- `page.Category(name, rows?, group?)` binds each row and returns the category
  object; `category.Bind(key, description, fn, options?)` returns the category
  so short chains work.
- `Keys.Bind(path, key, description, fn, options?)`: `path` is
  `[page, category]` or `[page, category, group]`.
- Binding a key on a page with `match` registers it under
  `HotIfWinActive(match)`; global pages register with no condition.
- Hotkeys are registered through `Keys.Binder`, a replaceable function
  (default: set `HotIfWinActive`, call `Hotkey`, reset), so tests can record
  bindings without creating real hotkeys.
- Options: `Row` (merged-row label) and `Text` (merged-row description, taken
  from the first entry that sets it). Entries in the same group with the same
  `Row` render as one line, shown as bound only if all of them are bound.

## Keys and notation (`KeyName`)

Both AHK hotkey syntax (`!+h`, `^;`, `#Space`) and written notation
(`Alt+Shift+H`, `Ctrl+;`, `Win+Space`) parse to one canonical form: a
modifier set plus a key name. Canonical forms are compared to merge duplicates:
a key both documented and bound appears once, as bound.

Display is set by the theme's `keyStyle`:

| keyStyle | Example |
|---|---|
| `text` | `Ctrl+Shift+T` |
| `symbols` | `⌃⇧T` |
| `ahk` | `^+t` |

Written notation that does not parse to a single key (ranges like
`Ctrl+1–8`, sequences) is kept verbatim for display and never merged.

## Overlay behavior

Opening (help key, default Alt+/, set in `Help.ahk`):

- Exactly one page's `match` is active → open that page.
- Several match → an index of only those pages.
- None → the full index.

Levels:

1. **Index**: all pages with a letter each (front matter `key:` or code
   `Key` option, otherwise the first unused letter of the title).
2. **Page**: its categories as a lettered list. If the whole page fits on one
   screen, it is shown flattened instead: categories as headings, all keys
   visible.
3. **Category**: its entries under `###` group headings, in columns; overflow
   continues on further screens, shown as `2/3` in the footer.

Keys while open (claimed via `#HotIf Help.Visible` hotkeys, unmodified only;
letter hotkeys use a narrower `#HotIf Help.Visible && Help.ClaimsLetters`,
true only on list screens):

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| letter | drill down (list screens only); unassigned letters are ignored |
| Backspace | up one level; from an app page up to the full index |
| Space / PgDn, PgUp | next / previous screen |
| `` ` `` | toggle pin |
| Esc, help key | close |
| plain letter on a key-list screen | close, key passes through (not claimed) |
| any Ctrl/Alt/Win combo | close (unless pinned), key passes through |

The overlay never takes focus (`WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`), so passed-through keys
reach the active app. A visible-mode `InputHook` (sees keys without
suppressing them) closes it on a Ctrl/Alt/Win combo unless pinned. It also
closes when the active window changes. In pinned mode it stays up through
combos and focus changes until Esc, the help key or the pin key.

## Rendering and theming

`Overlay` draws one screen into a `Gui` with `+AlwaysOnTop -Caption
+ToolWindow +E0x08000000`, rounded corners and border via DWM, centered on the
active monitor's work area (`WindowLauncher.ActiveMonitorWorkArea()`). Text is
measured before layout, so column widths fit their content. Each navigation
step rebuilds the screen.

Screen parts: title, optional legend, headings and entries, footer (level
hints, `n/m` screen count, 📌 when pinned, warning count when page files had
problems).

Theme settings (INI, `Help/themes/<name>.ini`, sections as below):

| Section | Settings |
|---|---|
| `[colors]` | `background`, `border`, `title`, `category`, `group`, `keyBound`, `keyDoc`, `description`, `footer`, `pinned`, `warning` |
| `[fonts]` | `uiFont`, `keyFont`, `titleSize`, `headingSize`, `bodySize` |
| `[layout]` | `padding`, `rowSpacing`, `maxColumns`, `maxHeightPercent`, `opacity`, `rounded` |
| `[keys]` | `keyStyle` (`text` / `symbols` / `ahk`), `legend` (`off` / `top` / `bottom`) |

Missing settings fall back to built-in defaults (Catppuccin Mocha, `keyDoc` a
muted lavender, `keyStyle = text`, `legend = off`). Invalid values fall back to
the default and add a warning. Shipped themes: `catppuccin-mocha.ini` and
`catppuccin-latte.ini`. The selected theme is set in `Help/settings.ini`
(`theme = auto | <name>`); `auto` picks Latte or Mocha from Windows'
`AppsUseLightTheme` each time the overlay opens.

The legend lists only the notation used on the current screen (e.g.
`⌃ Ctrl  ⌥ Alt  ⇧ Shift  ⊞ Win`, or `^ Ctrl  ! Alt  + Shift  # Win` for
`ahk`). With `keyStyle = text` it is not shown.

## Modules

All in `Lib/Help/`:

| Module | Job | Unit-tested |
|---|---|---|
| `KeyName.ahk` | parse AHK and written notation to canonical form; format per `keyStyle`; legend symbols | yes |
| `PageFile.ahk` | Markdown text → page model + warnings | yes |
| `Keys.ahk` | registry, `Page`/`Category`/`Bind`, merge with page files, bound/doc-only marking, `Binder` | yes |
| `Navigator.ahk` | state (level, selection, screen, pinned); key → new state + action (`redraw` / `close` / `pass` / `none`); opening page resolution; index letters | yes |
| `Layout.ahk` | screen content + measure function → columns and screens | yes (fake measurer) |
| `Theme.ahk` | defaults, INI loading with fallback, `auto` light/dark | yes (INI part) |
| `Overlay.ahk` | draw a laid-out screen | manual |
| `Help.ahk` | help key, navigation hotkeys, pass-through `InputHook`, focus-change close; loads pages and theme at startup | manual |

Data model: Page {Title, Match, Letter, Categories} → Category {Name, Groups}
→ Group {Name, Entries} → Entry {Key (canonical or verbatim), Description,
Bound, Row, Text}. `Overlay` and `Layout` read only this model.

`autohotkey.ahk` includes `Lib/Help/*.ahk` before `WindowManager.ahk`; page
files are loaded when `Help.ahk` initializes, before any `Keys` bindings are
merged for display.

## Migration

- `WindowManager.ahk`: komorebi hotkeys become `Keys` tables on a `komorebi`
  page (categories matching today's comment groups); `BindWorkspaceHotkeys`
  uses the one-line `Keys.Bind`; `CheatSheet` and its `!/`/`Esc` hotkeys are
  removed. `SecurityPrompts` is unchanged.
- `hotkeys.ahk`: the Zen `#+o` binding moves to a `Zen` page. Reload/exit
  hotkeys go on a global `AutoHotkey` page.
- `ChordOverlay.ShowCentered` / `RoundCorners` stay for the chord menu;
  `Overlay` has its own theme-aware equivalents.
- New `Help/pages/zen.md` with a few native Zen shortcuts as a doc-only example.
- Out of scope: hotstrings, the Win+Space chord menu, exporting code bindings to
  Markdown.

## Testing

- `tests/Help.Tests.ahk`: headless unit tests with a small built-in assert
  helper, run as `AutoHotkey64.exe /ErrorStdOut tests/Help.Tests.ahk`; prints
  one line per test, exit code = failure count. Covers:
  - `KeyName`: `^;`, `Ctrl+=`, `Ctrl+|`, `+` as a key, `#Space`, backtick keys,
    round-trips in all three styles, verbatim ranges.
  - `PageFile`: the example above, front matter, entries before headings,
    double-backtick keys, malformed lines → warnings with line numbers.
  - `Keys`: `Page()` identity, doc+bound merge by canonical key, merged rows,
    code-vs-file `match` conflict warning, `Binder` receives the right
    `HotIfWinActive` criteria.
  - `Navigator`: every row of the key table, flattened vs listed pages,
    Backspace from app page, pinned mode, index letter assignment and
    collisions, opening resolution for 0/1/many matches.
  - `Layout`: single screen, column overflow, multi-screen pagination.
  - `Theme`: partial INI falls back to defaults, invalid value warns.
- `tests/Verify-AutoHotkeyStructure.ps1`: runs the unit tests and `/Validate`
  on `autohotkey.ahk`; komorebi assertions updated to the new API.
- Manual checklist:
  - Zen active → Zen page; other window → index; drill down, Backspace up.
  - Long sample page paginates; `n/m` correct.
  - Alt+H while open closes the overlay and moves komorebi focus.
  - Win+Shift+O in Zen while open closes and runs the binding.
  - Pin: combos pass through and the overlay stays; `` ` `` unpins.
  - `theme = auto` follows a Windows light/dark switch.
  - Doc-only keys show in `keyDoc` color; a documented-and-bound key shows once
    as bound.
  - `legend = top` with `symbols` and `ahk` styles.
  - A broken `.md` line shows the warning count; script still starts.
